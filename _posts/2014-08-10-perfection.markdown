<h3> Perfection is never achieved for the first time in anything. why? </h3>
In this blog, i will try to illustrate my experience and thoughts about achieving perfection (specially while writing code).

why is it that most of what we do is not perfect at the first instant when we attempt to do it?
may be it's related to how our human brains work and the theory of learning.. you get better at anything you do only when you do it for years, that is how we become experts, but when you ask any expert, he will say he has more to learn and he continues to practice! has anyone become perfect in any field?

I think we cannot achieve perfection, we move towards perfection through the recursion of the steps - "formulate", "evaluate", "stare", "loop" (FESL).

Every time i write code, I follow endless repetition of FESL! i write code, i evaluate its correctness and then the most important step of just staring at the code for long until i find some room for improvement and repeat FESL again.
The improvement could be just a cosmetic change to make it look good, or it could be a performance optimisation or even it could be just simplifying the code by deleting unwanted elements (most of the time it’s about deleting the code).

Though people say that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, I tend to feel that everything in this world moves towards perfection not because you want to, but its just the way it works. I even agree what tao te ching quotes as “recognise beauty and ugliness is born”, but one thing which is inevitable is that everything that happens around us and everything we do always moves towards a state (without giving us a choice) which makes us feel good about it, a state of perfection, a state where you just gaze at the beauty of the work and feel proud you made it through to this point. obviously the FESL is a never ending process, but the more you do it, you will know when exactly to stop after a lot of FESL iterations.

Should we really stop? when do you know that you have achieved perfection?
The simple answer is you can’t quantify it and you will never stop! you will stop it temporarily and you will come back to it again after a month or an year or a decade and repeat the FESL process on the piece of work/code you worked on before, may be you want to rebuild it with a new fancy language! (like what i have been doing now with Elixir language)

The moment you think that you have achieved perfection, you will find a new way which u strongly feel is a better way than the one you used to build the work.
Achieving perfection is just like the mystery of the 2 slit experiment in quantum physics! where the moment you try to measure the particle’s position and path, it changes it’s course and it is almost impossible to measure both the position and the path of a particle (uncertainty principle).
That’s the way nature works, though we have arrived at certain laws like newtons laws which models certain behaviour of our world perfectly in the macroscopic world, it fails to explain the behaviour of particles in subatomic world... quantum physicists have a lot of theory about the dynamics of particles in the subatomic world and may be it might completely replace newtonian laws (i am not a physicist to even talk about it) but I am sure we cannot arrive at a model that explains everything around us perfectly! We will inturn have new models every day which is better than the old model. Every model will be failed and a new model comes up replacing the older model. The more the theoretical physicists explore nature’s mysteries, the better model they come up with which replaces the older model and this i feel is again the FESL process of getting to a state where we humans feel that we have found an equation which governs everything in the universe, but I feel that’s impossible! we will continue to journey on that path to find the ultimate model/equation but we will never arrive at a conclusion, just like the state of perfection… The journey will be exciting and fun, along the way we will model certain observation and even prove its correctness using mathematical equations, but we can always be sure that there are new possibilities awaiting for your attention which will give us better insights than the old model.

In conclusion, Every work we do, every code we write, every architecture we build, don't think it’s perfect! there is always something that can replace what we already have, there is always a better way to solve a problem which we already solved, we should have an attitude of accepting that fact and walk in the path of perfection continuously. I am sure that might cost us a lot of time, but don’t look at it as business, look at it as an art!
