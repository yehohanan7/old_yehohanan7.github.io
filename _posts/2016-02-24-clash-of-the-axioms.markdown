Before I even say what this blog is all about, how do I know I can convey my ideas correctly? I trust that the formal system called language that we share with each other helps us to communicate accurately. But can all ideas or truths be expressed in a formal (axiomatic) system? Hell no!
But what could we do? After all, We are evolved with just 5 senses and a mind that uses just a single model of thinking - The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_system">axiomatic system</a>! <br/> <br/>

But could we exit the formal system of our mind? Could we think beyond words? Could we share ideas without words? Could we think without a true/false conclusions? Maybe we could, maybe we were a species of higher consciousness in the past but now devolved into a materialistic formal thinking species. Maybe it's time to wake up and realize that we are actually not advancing, technological advancement alone is not a real progress - It's just a trap that sinks us deeper into the formal systems and paralyzes us and strips us off from our remaining senses that we are left with.<br/> <br/>

Have we ever wondered why the best philosophers/philosophies are from the past? That's a good evidence that we as a human race are declining with an illusion that we are advancing. Money takes the stage in our life, no time to think about thinking, no time to understand morale, no time to live in the present - all we do is use our time to plan for our future comfort and we die without living a single second. But when we were babies, we lived every second truly with a mind that was not infected with any formal systems.<br/> <br/>

I strongly believe a lot of people are asking the same kind of existentialism questions, this is good news, it hints us that we started ascending towards a spiritual betterment which is exactly what the mayans predicted for the year 2012<br/> <br/>

Having said that the only model we use for thinking is the axiomatic model, how do we know that our axioms are true? We "believe" that our axioms are true and any demonstration built on top of the accepted axioms can be proved to be true, but we cannot prove that the axioms are essentially true. That sounds weird for a rational mind, isn't it?<br/> <br/>

Even if we accept the fact that the axioms are true, it is again not possible to demonstrate all truths in an axiomatic system - a consistent formal system cannot be complete, this was proved by Kurt Godel in his ingenious paper titled “On formally undecidable propositions of Principia
Mathematica and related systems”<br/> <br/>

If our axioms cannot be proved and our formal systems are not complete, why do we argue over everything? How can we prove that a certain opinion is true and certain opinion is false?<br/> <br/>

I am a developer and I do a lot of pair programming, which means I get into a lot of debate all the time. The very act of debate is fun, but how can we prove the conclusion is really correct? 
If two people have the same axioms in their mental model then it's very obvious that there is no place for conflict or the argument will be settled very easily.<br/> <br/>

Conflict raises only when the two parties have different axioms (belief systems), and how do they settle an argument? All arguments are essentially a conflict between two systems with different axioms, the result of an argument is just an alteration to one system either by adding new axioms or removing an existing axiom, both in my opinion is meaningless as axioms are not provable. But we still do, why does one person accept a change to his formal system? I believe it’s because he sees an interesting pattern in the other person’s formal system, the very act of looking at a new axiomatic system might trigger some pleasure signals in our brain, just the same way when you look at a beautiful flower. This strange experience convinces that one set of axioms are better than the other and a person takes an extreme step of altering his own set of axioms to match the other person’s axioms just to feel a sense of harmony within.<br/> <br/>

If you have read the book “zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance”, the author inquires profound question of what “quality” actually is, the book will take you through a journey where you will try to understand “quality” and ask interesting questions like can we measure quality, can everything be rationalized etc etc.<br/> <br/>

So, the fundamental question that we ask now is - what is the quality a person sees in a formal system that makes him change his belief system? We are fundamentally pattern seeking beings, we think in patterns and chunks, we make decisions using intuition or subconscious which works purely on patterns. And patterns are not created by the mind, it is only recognized by the mind, patterns exist timelessly, patterns live and we just identify it and experience the presence of it and admire the beauty of it. Everything has a pattern, randomness is just an unknown pattern waiting to be identified. <br/> <br/>

Do you know that the average sinuosity of rivers tend towards the value pi? it’s a beautiful pattern isn’t it? the recognition of such patterns trigger harmonious signals in our brain.<br/> <br/>

Every developer might have read the Gang of four book on the design patterns, it was actually inspired by the idea proposed by Christopher Alexander in his book “The timeless way of building where he talks about these patterns and how to identify a living pattern and naming it and building a specific vocabulary (formal system) to communicate with each other, what results is a living pattern in the minds of the people. even if the minds die, the patterns live! ideas never die, patterns never die.<br/> <br/>

A lot of people misunderstand just cosmetic beauty with a living pattern. for instance, I have seen people debate hours over the syntax of checked & unchecked exceptions and the consequence of a throws syntax in the method signature of Java language. Instead, the minds should focus more on identifying interesting and deeper patterns like modularity, reusability and composability of the code. <br/>
Likewise, understanding the brain cells will not explain the abstract concepts like the mind, idea, intuitions, beliefs etc. neither will the understanding of the internals of a turing machine will explain the abstract concept of the turing machine, the turing machine is a reflection of a profound pattern! <br/>
what makes a good literature? the english alphabets using which the literature is written or the patterns/ideas that it conveys? <br/><br/>

Also in recent days with the agile movement in software industry, a lot of people’s mind is infected with the “Just enough” principle - of course pragmatism is important, but not with the expense of disturbing patterns and copy pasting code to get things done - that sounds like building a pyramid by skipping few layers inbetween. <br/>
I prefer a very strict bottom up development practice, which promotes the development of a pattern language to name every abstraction and also allows us to compose these abstractions to build even more composable abstractions/patterns <br/> <br/>

Identifying patterns and building “reusable” abstractions is the art of software development, who paid attention that the map/reduce patterns could be further decomposed into beautiful patterns called transducers which was introduced in Clojure by rich hickey - that’s true art!<br/> <br/>

In conclusion, I just want to mention that when two axiomatic systems clash, the motives shouldn’t be to prove the correctness of one axiom over other, which is impossible and stupid. The only motive should be to identify patterns in a formal system that solves a problem, the pattern which bring true harmony amidst a conflicting environment which is a quality that cannot be described in words nor can be measured but could be experienced and eventually named. True learning is when you have a mind of a beginner at every moment and an open eye (or hidden senses) to recognize the harmony produced by the living patterns! <br/> <br/>

Here ends the demonstration of a theorem from my axioms :) <br/>
